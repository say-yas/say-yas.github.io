Dr. Jindong Wang is currently a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. He obtained his Ph.D from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 with the excellent PhD thesis award. His research interest includes machine learning, large language models, and AI for social science. He has published over 50 papers with 10000+ citations at leading conferences and journals such as ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, TPAMI, IJCV etc. His research is reported by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/11/11/the-answer-to-why-emotionally-worded-prompts-can-goose-generative-ai-into-better-answers-and-how-to-spur-a-decidedly-positive-rise-out-of-ai/?sh=38038fb137e5) and other international media. In 2023, he was selected by Stanford University as one of the [World's 2% Scientists](https://ecebm.com/2023/10/04/stanford-university-names-worlds-top-2-scientists-2023/) and one of the [AI Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner. He has several Google scholar highly cited papers, Huggingface featured papers, and paperdigest most influential papers. He received the best paper award at ICCSE'18 and IJCAI'19 workshop. He serves as the associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), guest editor for ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), area chair for NeurIPS, KDD, ACMMM, and ACML, senior program committee member of IJCAI and AAAI. He leads several impactful open-source projects, including [transferlearning](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning), [PromptBench](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench), [torchSSL](https://github.com/torchssl/torchssl), [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-superised-learning), [personalizedFL](https://github.com/microsoft/PersonalizedFL), and [robustlearn](https://github.com/microsoft/robustlearn), which received over 16K stars on Github. He published a book [Introduction to Transfer Learning](http://jd92.wang/tlbook). He gave tutorials at [IJCAI'22](https://dgresearch.github.io/), [WSDM'23](https://dgresearch.github.io/), [KDD'23](https://mltrust.github.io/), and [AAAI'24](https://ood-timeseries.github.io/).

**Research interest:** (See this [page](https://jd92.wang/research/) for more details)
- Machine learning: robust machine learning, OOD / domain generalization, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications.
- Large language models: LLM [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/), [enhancement](https://llm-enhance.github.io/), and AI for social sciences.
